Yes, computer is fixed! I've reverted the decoder to the exact 3-layer architecture as per the paper (matching the original implementation). 

If images are still blurry with the correct architecture, it's likely due to:
- Insufficient training steps (need 10,000+ steps, not just 2000-3000)
- Hyperparameters (KL weight, learning rate) might need adjustment
- Image normalization when saving/displaying

I'll run training now with the correct 3-layer architecture and share the results. The architecture now exactly matches the paper, so if blur persists, it's a training/hyperparameter issue, not the architecture.

Let me train and show you the images shortly.
