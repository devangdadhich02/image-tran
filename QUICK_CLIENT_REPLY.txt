Hi! I've made the changes you requested:

1. ✅ Classification loss disabled: Set loss_multiplier_y to 0. The model will now focus only on reconstruction (no classification component in the loss).

2. ✅ KL weight increased: Changed from 0.00005 to 0.0001 for better regularization. The KL annealing still applies (starts at 0 and gradually increases).

3. 📝 About new_optimizer function:
   This function creates a new optimizer instance for the model. It:
   - Takes model parameters as input
   - Reads optimizer settings from config (type: adam/sgd, learning rate, weight decay)
   - Creates and returns the optimizer (Adam, SGD, or AdamW)
   
   It's mainly used when cloning the algorithm - it creates a fresh optimizer for the cloned model with the same hyperparameter settings. This keeps optimizer configuration centralized.

The updated config now has:
- loss_multiplier_y: 0 (classification disabled)
- loss_multiplier_kl: 0.0001 (increased)

Ready to train with reconstruction-only focus!
