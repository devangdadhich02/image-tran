bhai sab chize read karle and listen this is what my client send it to me :

[6:55 PM, 12/29/2025] Rahul Singh Singh Khangarot: seeking an experienced machine learning engineer to help debug a beta - variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is encountering training errors, specifically in the training loop, and the model is not converging. I need help creating code for a subset of data and to implement KL annealing.

Requirements:
- Expertise in neural networks and VAEs.
- Strong understanding of training loops in deep learning.
- Experience with debugging training issues.
- Proficiency in Python and frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

::has progress been made? on the DR dataset?
in teh folder called updated files
in teh folder called updated files
We have a β-VAE project where the model trains without runtime errors but is not converging properly in terms of reconstruction quality.

Problem summary:

Dataset: eye images

Current issue: model reconstructs only coarse shape and color, but fails to reconstruct fine vessel structures

Codebase is adapted from the authors’ GitHub of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11301

This is not a bug, it’s a representation & convergence issue

Your tasks:

Review the existing training loop and loss formulation.

Diagnose KL imbalance (posterior collapse or over-regularization).

Implement proper KL annealing (linear or cyclical, as suitable).

Verify architecture consistency with the paper (latent size, depth).

Test on a small subset of data for fast iteration.

Improve reconstruction so vessel structures are clearly visible, not just shape/color.

Train until stable convergence and export final trained model weights.

Deliverables required by client:

Fixed & optimized β-VAE training loop

KL annealing implementation

Subset-data training script

Explanation of what was wrong and how it was fixed

Final trained model weights that reconstruct images well

Priority is high. Client expects visible improvement and wants to be kept in the loop with progress.

I want it to reconstruct images like in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11301

 
resolve these issues and let me know  how would i  test them also and how to run them as well as make sure ki client ki sab reequipment's sahi se ho got it
